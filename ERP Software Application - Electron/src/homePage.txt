                    <b><u>My goal for this project implementation & mock-up</u></b> : 
                    <br></br>
                    As the son of a small business owner, I have personally the struggle of small businesses to learn and implement an effective ERP system. 
                    Oftentimes, it is too time consuming and requires expertise. When implemented properly an ERP can greatly streamline business processes and 
                    increase efficiency. I am seeking to reach out to local small businesses to gather information about the needs, wants, and desires of a new 
                    system as well as the downfalls of the current systems. The development process I will roughly pursue is as follows: <br></br>
                        (1) Define the goals and objectives <br></br>
                        (2) Identify the target users, potential clients, and stakeholders <br></br>
                        (3) Analyze the current state of affairs <br></br>
                        (4) Understand business processes <br></br>
                        (5) Plan! Set realistic expectations <br></br>
                        (6) Ensure alignment with vision and mission of the system and the client <br></br>
                        (7) Develop and deliver <br></br>
                        (8) Observe, analyze, and interpret results (customer satisfaction) <br></br>

        This is where I can display some survey data or something like that or further information about the database,
        the projects, or the functions behind the application or reasoning as to why it was chosen
