<div id = "homePage" class = "homePage"> <h4>Home Page</h4>
    <p class = "homePage mainContent">
         Here I can type whatever info I wish to display, such as my work scheduling form which has now been deleted but as you can see
         this text here will just keep going and stay lined up. The way in which I decided to handle this is all the page hide visibilty.
         This is not the most efficient way, an alternative could be to just an AJAX style of format to create synchronous events that 
         alter the innerHTML elements to display different things. THIS IS WORKING<br>
                                                                          
    </p>
                        
</div>
